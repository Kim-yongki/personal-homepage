## 🚀 How to Use
- Clone or download this repo.  
- Go into `App.jsx` and modify only **Section 0 (CONFIG)** and **Section 1 (DATA)**.  
  - Section 0 → personal info, navigation, hero title, etc.  
  - Section 1 → publications, projects, talks.  
- That’s it — everything else (layout, UI) will work automatically.  

This makes it easy to adapt for your own academic / research portfolio with minimal edits.
